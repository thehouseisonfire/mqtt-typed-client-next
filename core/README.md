# MQTT Typed Client Core

Core functionality for type-safe async MQTT client with automatic topic routing.

This crate contains the fundamental components:
- MQTT client implementation with async/await support
- Topic pattern matching and wildcard routing
- Message serialization abstraction
- Connection management and error handling

## Usage

This crate is typically used through the main `mqtt-typed-client` crate which provides a more ergonomic API with procedural macros.

For direct usage:

```rust
use mqtt_typed_client_core::{MqttClient, BincodeSerializer};

let (client, connection) = MqttClient::<BincodeSerializer>::connect("mqtt://broker.example.com").await?;
```

See the main [mqtt-typed-client](https://crates.io/crates/mqtt-typed-client) crate for complete examples and documentation.
