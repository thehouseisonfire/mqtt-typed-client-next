//! Topic handling module - re-exported from mqtt-topic-engine
//!
//! This module provides components for working with MQTT topic patterns,
//! including parsing, matching, and routing messages based on topic patterns.

// Re-export everything from mqtt-topic-engine
// `TopicMatchError` is not re-exported from the engine root, only from its
// `topic_match` submodule, so bring it into the flat `topic::` namespace
// explicitly for backward compatibility with v0.1.0.

//
// Note: the internal matcher machinery (`TopicMatcherNode`, `Len`) is intentionally
// NOT re-exported — it was public only incidentally and is not part of the stable API.
