/// Outcome of a single `receive()`/`recv()` call.
///
/// `None` from the receiving method still means the subscription is closed;
/// this enum describes the *non-terminal* outcomes of a call that produced
/// something. Lagging is modeled as an **event**, not an error: the stream is
/// healthy and the next buffered message is intact — you were merely told that
/// some earlier messages were dropped.
///
/// `#[non_exhaustive]`: future kinds of stream event may be added without a
/// breaking change, so external `match`es need a wildcard arm.
///
/// # Consuming — do NOT `while let Some(Message(..))`
///
/// A `DecodeFailed` or `Lagged` event refutes a
/// `while let Some(ReceiveEvent::Message(m)) = sub.receive().await` pattern and
/// **silently ends the loop** — under load `Lagged` is common, so that shape
/// turns backpressure into a dead consumer. Match every variant:
///
/// ```ignore
/// while let Some(event) = sub.receive().await {
///     match event {
///         ReceiveEvent::Message(m) => { /* handle */ }
///         ReceiveEvent::DecodeFailed(e) => { /* log */ }
///         ReceiveEvent::Lagged { missed } => { /* warn: dropped `missed` */ }
///         _ => {}
///     }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// or opt out explicitly with [`message`](Self::message) (problems are already
/// logged by the library):
///
/// ```ignore
/// while let Some(event) = sub.receive().await {
///     let Some(m) = event.message() else { continue };
