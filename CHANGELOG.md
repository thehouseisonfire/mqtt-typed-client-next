## [0.3.0] - 2026-07-10

### Changed — public API de-leak (BREAKING)

The public API no longer exposes `rumqttc` types, with three documented
exemptions: the semver-exempt `backend` module (`unstable-backend-api`
feature), the `rustls` re-export (TLS features), and the engine `QoS`'s
optional `to_rumqttc()`/`From<rumqttc::QoS>` conversions. This is the
prerequisite for the planned backend switch and MQTT 5 support (0.4) landing
WITHOUT another breaking release. Migration map:

| 0.2 | 0.3 |
| --- | --- |
| `use rumqttc::QoS` / re-exported `QoS` | `mqtt_typed_client::QoS` (protocol-neutral, same variants) |
| `config.connection: rumqttc::MqttOptions` | `config.connection: ConnectionOptions` (own type) |
| `.set_keep_alive(d)` | `config.connection.keep_alive = d` |
| `.set_clean_session(true/false)` | `config.connection.session = SessionPolicy::CleanPerConnection / ::Resume` |
| `.set_credentials(u, p)` | `config.connection.credentials = Some(Credentials { .. })` |
| `.set_transport(Transport::tls_with_config(c))` | `config.connection.transport = Transport::Tls(c.into())` |
| `.set_inflight(..)`, `.set_max_packet_size(..)`, other backend knobs | `backend_tweak(..)` behind the `unstable-backend-api` feature (SEMVER-EXEMPT) |
| `from_url` → `rumqttc::OptionError` | `from_url` → `UrlParseError` (own type) |
| URL params `inflight_num`, `request_channel_capacity_num`, `max_request_batch_num`, `pending_throttle_usecs`, `max_*_packet_size_bytes` | rejected with an explicit error pointing to the escape hatch |
| URL param `conn_timeout_secs` (never actually accepted by rumqttc's grammar) | rejected with a pointer to `ClientSettings.connection_timeout_millis` |
| native TLS via `set_transport(Transport::Tls(TlsConfiguration::Native))` | not spelled by `Transport::Tls` in 0.3 (rustls only); enable `tls-native` + `unstable-backend-api`, keep `Transport::Tcp` and set the backend transport in `backend_tweak` |
| `BrokerRejected { code: rumqttc::ConnectReturnCode }` | `BrokerRejected { code: ConnectReasonCode }` (v5-superset enum) |
| `MqttClientError::ClientOperation(rumqttc::ClientError)` | `ClientOperation(ClientOperationError)` |
| `Network(Box<rumqttc::ConnectionError>)` | `Network(BackendError)` (opaque, keeps Display + source chain) |
| feature `rumqttc-use-rustls` etc. | `tls-rustls`, `tls-rustls-no-provider`, `tls-native`, `websocket`, `proxy` (old names remain as deprecated aliases; removed in 0.4) |
| feature `rumqttc-url` | gone — URL parsing is built in |
| re-export `tokio_rustls` | gone (`rustls` is still re-exported under the TLS features) |

### Added
- `ConnectionOptions` with `SessionPolicy` (v5-shaped: `CleanPerConnection` /
  `Resume` / `ResumeFor` — the latter is MQTT 5 only and errors on v4),
  `ProtocolVersion` (`?protocol=4|5` in URLs; `V5` gives a clean "arrives in
  0.4" connect error), own `Transport`/`TlsConfig` enums.
- Connect-time validation instead of backend panics: sub-second `keep_alive`,
  `Resume` with an empty `client_id`, and unsupported transports now return
  `MqttClientError::ConfigurationValue`.
- `unstable-backend-api` feature: `ConnectionOptions::backend_tweak` gives raw
  access to backend options at connect time (semver-exempt), and
  `backend::rumqttc` re-exports the backend crate version-matched.
- All public error enums are `#[non_exhaustive]`; new `ConnectReasonCode`,
  `BackendError`, `ClientOperationError`, `UrlParseError` types.
- Configurable per-subscription backpressure: `SubscriptionConfig` gained
  `channel_capacity`, `slow_send_timeout`, and `max_parked_messages` (were
  hardcoded 500 / 2s / 100), with matching builder methods
  `with_channel_capacity` / `with_slow_send_timeout` / `with_max_parked_messages`.
- Drop visibility: `dropped_messages() -> u64` on the subscriber types reports
  messages dropped because the consumer could not keep up.
- Per-message metadata: `MessageMeta` (`qos`, `retain`, `dup`, and a reserved
  `v5: Option<Mqtt5Meta>` slot, always `None` on MQTT 3.1.1) is now delivered
  with every message. `#[mqtt_topic]` structs can add an optional `meta` field
  to receive it; `MessageMeta::new` is public so you can build one in your own
  tests.
- Arc-adaptive reserved fields in `#[mqtt_topic]`: `topic` and `meta` accept
  either the bare type (`TopicMatch` / `MessageMeta`, handed to you owned) or the
  shared `Arc<...>` (zero-copy — the recommended default).
- Connection state observability: `MqttClient::connection_state() ->
  watch::Receiver<ConnectionState>` reports the lifecycle
  (`Connected { session_present }` / `Reconnecting { attempt }` /
  `Disconnected { reason }`, terminal). `ConnectionState`/`DisconnectReason` are
  own `#[non_exhaustive]` protocol-neutral enums (v5 fields land additively).

### Fixed
- Slow-consumer message reordering: a message parked for a slow subscriber could
  be overtaken by a later message delivered directly. Delivery is now strictly
  FIFO per subscriber — at most one in-flight send, with later messages queued
  behind it (buffer → grace → drop policy; drops never reorder).
- Zombie consumers on terminal event-loop death: when the event loop exited on
  its own (broker DISCONNECT, or too many consecutive errors) the subscriber
  channels were never closed, so every consumer parked on `receive().await`
  forever — cleanup only ran on an explicit `MqttConnection::shutdown()`.
  Terminal death now runs the same cleanup, so `receive()` yields `None` and
  consumer loops terminate.

### Changed (BREAKING)
- `SubscriptionConfig` is now `#[non_exhaustive]` (MQTT 5 subscribe options
  arrive additively in 0.4): construct via `SubscriptionConfig::default()` +
  field assignment or the builder methods, not a struct literal.
- `Subscriber::new` is now `pub(crate)` (it was never meant to be called
  directly; subscribers come from `subscribe()`).
- Mid-layer `MqttSubscriber::receive()` now yields named structs instead of
  tuples: `ReceiveEvent::Message` carries `IncomingMessage<T> { topic, meta,
  payload }` (was `(Arc<TopicMatch>, T)`) and `ReceiveEvent::DecodeFailed`
  carries `DecodeFailure<E> { topic, meta, error }` (was `(Arc<TopicMatch>, E)`).
  Rewrite direct destructures (`Message((topic, val))` → `Message(msg)` then
  `msg.payload` etc.). Top-layer `#[mqtt_topic]` users are unaffected.
- `#[mqtt_topic]` reserves `payload`/`topic`/`meta` as field names: using one as
  a `{...}` wildcard **while also** declaring the same-named field is now a
  compile error (narrow — a `{meta}` wildcard with no `meta` field still
  compiles as a plain parameter). Only `{meta}` + a `meta` field is a new break;
  `{payload}`/`{topic}` collisions were already silently mis-binding.
- `FromMqttMessage::from_mqtt_message` gained a `meta: Arc<MessageMeta>` second
  argument (hand-written impls must add it; macro-generated impls update
  automatically).

### Changed
- crates.io `keywords`: replaced the redundant `tokio` with `typed` (identity
  term, less crowded) for `mqtt-typed-client` and `mqtt-typed-client-core`.
  Metadata-only; takes effect on the next published release.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-06-27

### Added
- Per-topic serializer override via the `mqtt_topic` macro attribute:
  `#[mqtt_topic("...", serializer = JsonSerializer)]`.
- `MqttClient::clone_with_serializer::<S>()` and `clone_with_custom_serializer(serializer)`.
- `CacheStrategy::capacity()` convenience method.
- Granular TLS / transport feature flags forwarding to `rumqttc`:
  `rumqttc-url`, `rumqttc-websocket`, `rumqttc-use-rustls`, `rumqttc-use-native-tls`,
  `rumqttc-proxy`. This lets you pick a TLS backend (rustls / native-tls) or build
  without TLS.
- `rumqttc-use-rustls-no-provider` feature — use rustls without bundling a crypto
  provider (e.g. `aws-lc-rs`), so you can bring your own (such as `ring`) and avoid
  the `aws-lc` cross-compilation pain on 32-bit / embedded targets.
- Re-exports so custom transports need no direct `rumqttc` dependency:
  `Transport` (always available, also in `prelude`), and — under a rustls feature —
  `tokio_rustls` and `rustls` (version-matched to the transport), for building a
  `ClientConfig` for `Transport::tls_with_config(...)`.
- New standalone crate `mqtt-topic-engine` — the topic pattern matching and routing
  engine, usable without the MQTT client.

### Changed
- **BREAKING (default features):** the default feature set now includes
  `rumqttc-url` and `rumqttc-use-rustls`, and `rumqttc` is pulled with
  `default-features = false`. If you relied on `rumqttc`'s default TLS being
  enabled implicitly, enable the corresponding `rumqttc-*` feature explicitly.
- The topic engine was extracted from `core` into the `mqtt-topic-engine` crate.
  Public types remain available through `mqtt_typed_client_core::topic::*`.
- Removed the `build.rs` documentation-generation step (supply-chain hardening —
  no build script). README and example docs are now embedded directly via
  `include_str!`, with example links pointing at absolute GitHub URLs so they
  resolve both on GitHub and on docs.rs.
- Upgraded `rumqttc` from 0.24 to 0.25.1. The public API surface used by this
  crate is unchanged; with default features (`rumqttc-use-rustls`) rustls now
  pulls `aws-lc-rs` as its crypto provider — use `rumqttc-use-rustls-no-provider`
  to opt out (see above).

### Removed
- **BREAKING:** the incidentally-public matcher internals `TopicMatcherNode<T>`
  and the `Len` trait are no longer part of the public API. They were never
  intended as a stable surface.

### Migration
- Recommended import path stays the curated root re-exports, e.g.
  `mqtt_typed_client_core::{CacheStrategy, TopicError, TopicPatternPath, ...}`.
- v0.1.0 submodule paths are preserved via backward-compat re-exports:
  `topic::error::*`, `topic::topic_router::*`, `topic::topic_pattern_item::*`,
  `topic::topic_matcher::TopicMatcherError`, `topic::topic_match::*`,
  `topic::topic_pattern_path::*`. `CacheStrategy` moved from
  `routing::subscription_manager` to `topic` (root re-export unchanged).
- `TopicMatchError` is now also available flat as `topic::TopicMatchError`.
