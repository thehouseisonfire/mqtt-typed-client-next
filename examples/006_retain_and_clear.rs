//! # MQTT Retain & Clear Messages Demo
//!
//! Demonstrates MQTT retained message functionality with multiple clients connecting
//! at different times to showcase how retained messages work in real-world scenarios.
//!
//! ## Key MQTT Concepts Demonstrated:
//!
//! **Retained Messages:**
//! - Broker stores the last retained message for each topic
//! - New subscribers immediately receive stored retained messages upon subscription
//! - Only one retained message per topic (new retained messages replace old ones)
//! - Retained messages persist even when publisher disconnects
//!
//! **Message Clearing:**
//! - `clear_retained()` sends empty payload with retain=true to remove stored message
//! - After clearing, new subscribers receive no retained messages
//! - The typed client automatically ignores empty payloads (clear events)
//!
//! **Multi-client Behavior:**
//! - Multiple clients can subscribe to same topic independently
//! - Each gets its own copy of retained messages upon subscription
//! - Non-retained messages only go to currently active subscribers
//!
//! ## Demo Timeline (20 seconds total):
//!
//! ```text
//! t=0s:  Publisher sends retained message #1 → stored by broker
//! t=1s:  Subscriber-1 connects → receives retained message #1
//! t=5s:  Publisher sends retained message #2 → replaces #1 in broker storage
//! t=6s:  Subscriber-2 connects → receives retained message #2 (not #1)
//! t=10s: Publisher sends non-retained message #3 → only Supervisor sees it
//! t=11s: Subscriber-3 connects → receives retained message #2 (not #3)
//! t=15s: Publisher clears retained message → broker storage now empty
//! t=16s: Subscriber-4 connects → receives nothing (no retained message available)
//! ```
//!
//! Topic pattern: "demo/retain" (fixed topic, no parameters)
//! Expected output: Shows how retained messages behave with different connection timing
