//! # Connection State Observability - MQTT Typed Client
//!
//! Demonstrates [`MqttClient::connection_state`]: a `tokio::sync::watch`
//! channel that reports the connection lifecycle
//! (`Connected` / `Reconnecting` / `Disconnected`).
//!
//! A background task watches the channel and logs every transition. The channel
//! is level-triggered (latest state wins; rapid transitions may collapse), but
//! the terminal `Disconnected` is never missed. Here we drive a clean
//! `shutdown()` and watch the observer see `Disconnected { CleanShutdown }`.
