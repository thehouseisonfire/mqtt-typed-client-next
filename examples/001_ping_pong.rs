//! # Ping Pong Game - MQTT Typed Client Example
//!
//! Demonstrates interactive bi-directional communication between two players
//! through MQTT topics using the typed client pattern.
//!
//! Key features showcased:
//! - Bi-directional messaging between multiple clients
//! - Game state management through MQTT
//! - Randomized game logic with probabilistic outcomes
//! - Concurrent player execution
//!
//! Topic pattern: "game/{player}"
//! - Alice subscribes to: "game/alice"
//! - Bob subscribes to: "game/bob"
//! - Publishing: client.publish("alice", message) → "game/alice"
//! - Receiving: "game/alice" → PingPongTopic { player: "alice", payload: deserialized_msg }
//!
//! Game flow:
//! 1. Both players subscribe to their respective topics
//! 2. Bob starts by sending Ping(0) to Alice
//! 3. Players alternate sending Ping/Pong messages with incrementing counters
//! 4. Each move has a 5% chance to end the game
//! 5. The player who sends GameOver loses, the other wins
