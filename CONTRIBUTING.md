### Reporting Bugs

Before creating a bug report, please:
1. Check the existing issues to see if the bug has already been reported
2. Update to the latest version to see if the issue persists

When creating a bug report, please include:
- A clear and descriptive title
- Steps to reproduce the behavior
- Expected behavior vs actual behavior
- Your environment (OS, Rust version, dependency versions)
- Minimal code example that demonstrates the issue

### Suggesting Features

Feature requests are welcome! Please:
1. Check existing issues to avoid duplicates
2. Clearly describe the feature and its use case
3. Explain why this feature would be beneficial to other users

### Pull Requests

1. **Fork** the repository
2. **Create** a feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/my-new-feature`
3. **Make** your changes
4. **Add tests** for new functionality
5. **Run tests**: `cargo test --all`
6. **Run clippy**: `cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features`
7. **Format code**: `cargo fmt --all`
8. **Commit** your changes: `git commit -am 'Add some feature'`
9. **Push** to the branch: `git push origin feature/my-new-feature`
10. **Submit** a pull request

### Development Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/holovskyi/mqtt-typed-client.git
cd mqtt-typed-client

# Run tests
cargo test --all

# Run examples
cargo run --example 000_hello_world

# Check formatting and linting
cargo fmt --all
cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features
```

### Testing

- Write tests for new functionality
- Ensure all existing tests pass
- Include integration tests for complex features
- Test with different MQTT brokers if possible
- Reconnect / fault-injection tests (deterministic network faults via
  `turmoil`) are planned — see [issue #3](https://github.com/holovskyi/mqtt-typed-client/issues/3).
  Run instructions will land here once the harness exists.

### Documentation

- Update documentation for new features
- Add examples for complex functionality
- Ensure all public APIs are documented
- Update CHANGELOG.md for notable changes

### Code Style

- Follow Rust standard formatting (`cargo fmt`)
- Address all clippy warnings
- Use descriptive variable and function names
- Add comments for complex logic
